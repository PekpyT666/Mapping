Added e_force_complete (by default are true)
Now if e_sequence_dur > -1 and player/camera/monster/npc are didn't get to the e_move_* in e_sequence_dur they will be instantaneously jumped to e_move_* (or the last e_next in waypoints chain) instead of just stoping where they are right now.
If you want old behaviour - set e_force_complete to false.

Added e_force_complete_smart (by default are false)
Set this to true to make player teleport with 1st level of teleportation spell (even if he didn't have it) intead of instantaneously jump (work if e_force_complete is true).
